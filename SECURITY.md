## Reporting a Vulnerability

The BCO Project appreciates all reports of vulnerabilities found and will make
efforts to fix any known security issues.

There are two methods to report a vulnerability depending on the ability to fix it.  
If you are able to fix the vulnerability in the code then please open a PR to the project with the fix.
