            "Until the present day, the majority of cancer genomic have been focusing on identifying the tumor gene and the pathways involving in tumor development. Despite of this being a huge success, there is still a little knowledge of why cancer patients with similar cancer driver genes may result in different disease outcome and/or drug responses. Therefore, there is a need of understanding deeper into this problem. First, it is essential to identify the genes that cause the cancer, or the cancer-driver genes. Therefore, the completion of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and other large scale genomic project are important because those projects will provide a critical and essential data to identify driver mutation that lead to cancer. Although it a fast-growing project, the TCGA is far from completed because of the mutation diversity and it is difficult to increase the size of the datasets. A complementary approach toward that goal is to integrate cancer mutation profiles and increase the statistical power of analysis. Moreover, information on the structure of the proteins coded by genes is checked to see the enrichment in cancer mutation in specific regions.",
            "In this publication, the authors introduce the extension of an e-Driver that use information on three-dimensional structures of the mutated proteins to identify specific structures. The algorithm analyzed if these structural feature are enriched in cancer somatic mutation and can become candidates of cancer-driver genes. The authors specifically pay attention on the protein-protein interaction (PPI) interfaces since a lot of cancer-driver genes are located in the important region of the PPI network. Here, the authors identified PPi interfaces in a total of 103 genes. 32 of these are well-known cancer-driver genes. The function of the remaining 71 still have to be verified experimentally. The authors also showed that depending on which interface or protein region is altered, tumors apparently driven by the same cancer gene may have different outcomes. ",
            "The result assembling a data set of 5,989 tumors from 23 cancer types from the TCGA showed that the average number of missense mutation per sample is highly variable among cancer types, with melanoma is the highest (429 mutations per sample) and thyroid carcinoma is the lowest (11 mutations per sample). Mutations from 868,508 cancer datasets are distributed randomly across the proteome with 30% of mutations in structures and 6% in PPI interfaces (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004518.g001). In 103 interface driver genes in the Pan-cancer analysis, there is a huge overlap between the genes identified in this analysis and lists of the known cancer genes (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004518.g002) (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004518.g003). The result also emphasizes the differences and similarities across related driver genes. The analysis of 71 interface driver genes that are identified as not cancer-driver genes determine their potential roles in cancer. Furthermore, they also have function which is related to immunity",
            "The raw data and the algorithm can be download from (http://github.com/eduardporta/e-Driver). The 3 level mutation data can be download from TCGA portal (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov) for 5,989 tumor samples that belongs to 23 different cancer types. 18,651 protein structures were identified from PDB (2014) for the analysis of residues implicated with PPI interfaces. The complete dataset containing PPI structures and models are from Interactome3D. e-Driver is used to identify interfaces that are enriched in somatic missense mutations,",
            "This is the first time that 3D PPI interfaces have been used to identify genes across large cancer datasets. The analysis showed that cancer driver genes, such as TP35, HRAS, PIK3CA or EGFR can find relevant genes and interaction interfaces alteration is a common pathogenic mechanism of cancer somatic mutation. The authors also found that tumors with mutations in the same driver gene can have different behavior and outcomes, depend on the PPI interface affected by the mutation. This research has focused on the analysis and interpretation of of missense mutation. However, there are other types of variations that still can act as cancer drivers and have a huge impact on the outcomes of the patients.",

            "Tempora is a tool for creating cell lineage trajectories using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Many tools exist for creating lineage trajectories (Monocle, TSCAN, Slingshot, etc) along a so called pseudotemporal scale. The scale is arranged using a variety of methods such as using a minimum spanning tree (MST) method that arranges cell clusters along an axis according to their transcriptome similarity, determined from the scRNA-seq data, such that the expression differences (\u201ctime\u201d) between all clusters is as small as possible. This and other methods solidly assume that the differences in gene expression are correlated to where along the time-path of a particular lineage each cell exists. Tempora partially removes this assumption by incorporating temporal data collected during time-course scRNA-seq experiments. Tempora\u2019s novel innovation over existing time course tools like Waddinton-OT and CSHMM is creating enriched, redundancy reduced, cluster-level pathways that use time series data to predict temporal directions between cell types. Fields like immunology and developmental biology are very interested in determining cell lineages and predicting trajectories to determine the systemic differences (and manipulating those systems) between progenitors and differentiated cells.   Tempora describes initial scRNA-seq data clean-up procedures and two workflows: generating cell lineage trajectories and determining temporally related pathways. This BCO will focus on the cell lineage trajectory workflow using a human skeletal muscle myoblast dataset. ",

Each cell cluster is then assigned a temporal score according to its cell composition from each time point in the data\u2019s series.

            "There are two main methods of assembling the genome: reference-based and de novo assembly. The reference-based assembly method is used when the genome of the target organism is available, and the reads are aligned to the reference. In this approach, the focus is on Accepting indels and multiple nucleotides in the structure and gene variant information (Chen et al., 2017). In de novo assembly, consensus sequences are generated without reference genomes by using heuristics to maintain single/ multiple nucleotide variants and indels (Li, 2012).",

            "Astrocytes are the most abundant glial cells in the brain. Over the past few decades, the classical view of astrocytes being merely supportive cells in the nervous system has dramatically extended to include the important roles of astrocytes in neuronal, blood vessel and glial function (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcb.2016.01.003). Astrocytes are known to respond to neurotransmitters released from neurons by increasing intracellular calcium. These calcium events can further propagate to neighboring cells through gap junctions, causing the release of gliotransmitters which bind to neuronal receptors and eventually facilitate synaptic transmission (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2014.02.007). This crosstalk between astrocytes and neurons via calcium signaling indicates the active role of astrocytes in neural signaling and synaptic plasticity (DOI: 10.1109/TMBMC.2022.3142621). ",
            "Given that astrocyte calcium signaling is critical to healthy regulation of neuronal activity and physiology, it is imperative to be able to study intercellular communication in astrocytes at the network level.  While there are existing methods for analyzing calcium events in astrocytes, these tools are limited to evaluating calcium signaling at an individual cellular level. Additionally, these tools are often based on using pre-defined regions of interest (ROIs), which may offer bias in analysis. ",
            "Astral is a novel tool that allows for analysis of the functional interactions between astrocytes mediated by their calcium signaling at the network level. Its unique pipeline quantifies astrocytic calcium events without the need for pre-defined ROIs, and analyzes intercellular propagation based on live-cell imaging. Astral consists of a core-processing pipeline for detection and quantification of Ca2+ events, as well as a visualization tool for data quality control. Altogether, Astral is powerful and novel tool that enables a novel approach in studying astrocyte-neuronal interactions at the network level ",

They are therefore considered pro-survival proteins given that a major characteristic of cancer is its ability to avoid programmed cell death (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10398099/). This makes them a therapeutic target for drug discovery (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28735187/). When there is intracellular stress, the apoptotic homeostasis is controlled by the activator and sensitizer BH3 (Bcl-2 homology 2)-only proteins. Changes in expression levels of these proteins can lead to an imbalance. More specifically, overexpression can cause oncogenic effects (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24355989/). Normally, the Bcl-2 family proteins will bind to the BH3 motif of pro-apoptotic proteins to create a network of protein-protein interactions, but any dysfunction will result in the cancer cells to evade cell death. This study emphasizes the importance of future experimental research on the protein network between Bcl-2 and BH3 within a breast cancer context.",

This BCO represents the steps taken to identify protein interaction partners of the Bcl-2 family members that contain the BH3 motif in breast cancer samples. This was done by first retrieving the experimentally known Bcl-2 family interactions from the human Integrated Interaction Database (IID), and then the interaction list was filtered to only include those proteins containing the BH3 motif. Out of the 560 protein-protein interactions that were collected, 295 of them were selected as possible BH3-containing proteins. Out of the 295 proteins, 282 were identified as BH-3 only."

            "Proteins of the B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) family are known to regulate programmed cell death through the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. They are therefore considered pro-survival proteins given that a major characteristic of cancer is its ability to avoid programmed cell death. This makes them a therapeutic target for drug discovery. When there is intracellular stress, the apoptotic homeostasis is controlled by the activator and sensitizer BH3 (Bcl-2 homology 2)-only proteins. Changes in expression levels of these proteins can lead to an imbalance. More specifically, overexpression can cause oncogenic effects. Normally, the Bcl-2 family proteins will bind to the BH3 motif of pro-apoptotic proteins to create a network of protein-protein interactions, but any dysfunction will result in the cancer cells to evade cell death. This study emphasizes the importance of future experimental research on the protein network between Bcl-2 and BH3 within a breast cancer context.",

This BCO represents the steps taken to identify protein interaction partners of the Bcl-2 family members that contain the BH3 motif in breast cancer samples. This was done by first retrieving the experimentally known Bcl-2 family interactions from the human Integrated Interaction Database (IID), and then the interaction list was filtered to only include those proteins containing the BH3 motif. Out of the 560 protein-protein interactions that were collected, 295 of them were selected as possible BH3-containing proteins. Out of the 295 proteins, 282 were identified as BH-3 only. "

Killer cell immunoglobulin- like receptors are key receptors for NK cells development and function in humans (https://doi.org/10.5045/kjh.2011.46.4.216). KIR's genes span 10-16kb each and recombination through the different haplotypes has made their order and copy number highly variable.

This approach is high cost and cannot be used for high scale studies.

This requires a more specific and careful interpretation of the KIR region than in most other regions in the human genome.

This approach is meant to efficiently capture 2-8kb fragments of DNA for better identification of haplotypes.  ",

            "The purpose of this study is to identify the integration sites of retroviruses including a common one which is the HIV virus. The pipeline describes the steps after the DNA has been clones and sequences. The sequencing left the sample with artifacts that are then reduced using a bioinformatics pipeline. The first step is to differentiate reads by using their sample index as well as identification of both 5\u2019and 3\u2019 ends. Next, reference genomes are used (human sequenced genomes that were infected with the HIV virus) for genome alignment using a BLAST-like tool.  The BLAT alignment allows for similar sequences to be classified at the chromosomal level based on a score system. The pipeline then removes sequences that do not match or that are not on the same chromosomes as artifacts. The alignment requires reads to be on the same chromosome, on opposite strands, with a size of not more than 1kb. The host breakpoint and the LTR DNA junctions only is considered a valid integration sites when those main criteria are met. In fact, this tool allows for the results to be less noisy as artifacts are removed thoroughly for better genomic outcomes.  The pipeline predicts priming sites from the sequenced genomes and provides raw data sequence for the discovered integrations sites. The pipeline analysis was established and published on BMC genomics. The citation is as follows Wells, D.W., Guo, S., Shao, W. et al.

The pipeline describes the steps after the DNA has been clones and sequences. The sequencing left the sample with artifacts that are then reduced using a bioinformatics pipeline. The first step is to differentiate reads by using their sample index as well as identification of both 5\u2019and 3\u2019 ends. Next, reference genomes are used (human sequenced genomes that were infected with the HIV virus) for genome alignment using a BLAST-like tool.  The BLAT alignment allows for similar sequences to be classified at the chromosomal level based on a score system. The pipeline then removes sequences that do not match or that are not on the same chromosomes as artifacts. The alignment requires reads to be on the same chromosome, on opposite strands, with a size of not more than 1kb. The host breakpoint and the LTR DNA junctions only is considered a valid integration sites when those main criteria are met. In fact, this tool allows for the results to be less noisy as artifacts are removed thoroughly for better genomic outcomes.  The pipeline predicts priming sites from the sequenced genomes and provides raw data sequence for the discovered integrations sites. "

This study demonstrates the relationship of N-glycosylation of breast cancer both in vitro and in vivo. Variable selection with CAMPP is implemented through linear models from mass spectrometry data for differential abundance analysis (DAA) and LASSO/Elastic-Net Regression. The result of this pipeline are tabular files and graphical representations of the dataset being studied. The biomolecules of interest from a large dataset can be found by applying different statistical tests and machine learning approaches. CAMPP creates a standardized way to screening for cancer biomarkers and other biomolecules of interest before their implementation in potential experiments.

Libraries were generated by performing HiChIP/HiChIRP (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-019-0407-x) and Illumina paired-end sequencing on the samples. Sequencing data is processed according to standard protocol, including alignment, duplicate removal and filtering with HiC-Pro, before generating interaction matrices and calling loops with Juicer HiCCUPS algorithm. The pipeline will produce a list of high-confidence loop calls. In the original experiment the examination of the loops indicated a high number of telomere-telomere interaction (92%); additionally, the results showed that TERC was also associated with loops beyond telomeric regions, specifically at enhancer-promoter regions of several  oncogenes, implying possible role of TERC beyond telomeres."

            "Alternative splicing is when multiple isoforms are made from the same gene due to alternative selection of exons or splice sites. Although alternative splicing generally produces linear RNA, one largely unexplored form leads to a circular form of RNA, called circRNA. There is a great amount of interest in these sequences and their interactions because they may be implicated in diseases such as cancer. As such, there have been numerous tools to find and detect circRNA sequences. Present tools only detect presence/absence of the sequence however and do not account for conditions where circRNA is differentially expressed, as it often is. SeekCRIT aims to solve this issue by offering detection, quantification, and statistical analysis for circRNAs. In this work, seekCRIT's capabilities are assessed using publicly available RNA data."
