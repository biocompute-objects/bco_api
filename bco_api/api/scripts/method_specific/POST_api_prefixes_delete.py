"""Delete a prefix

The requestor must be in the group prefix_admins to delete a prefix.
Any object created under this prefix will have its permissions "locked out."
This means that any other view which relies on object-level permissions, such
as /api/objects/drafts/read/, will not allow any requestor access to particular
objects.
